Design Description - Triage Application

The application consists of three classes, Database, Nurse and Patient. 
Database only have a Map<int, Patient> called patients, which used to store and save all patients and lable them to their health card number.Through method getPatients nurse can get a local copy of patients map. And method commit is used to commit the local patient map to the database.

Patient class has 2 Maps, 1 List, 1 Boolean and 1 Date veriables. A Map<Date, String> which record symptoms labled to record time and another Map(Date, list<double>)which record vital signs labled to record time. Another List<String> is used to record[name, date of birth, health card number]. Each patient object has a unique health card number which come from a static private veriable patientsNum when a new patient created. A boolean veriable called seenByDoctor can be changed by nurse to show if the patient have been seen by doctor. If it is true, this patient will be involved in some nurse's method. The Date arrivalTime would be recorded by nurse as soon as patient arrive in hospital. For every not static veriable in Patient, there is a corresponding "get" method to get that veriable which would be called by nurse when looking up the patient's information.

In patient method is called when nurse want to record any information. Its parameters are well-listed corresponding to all kinds of patient's information. If a parameter is set, the veriable corresponding to its place would be changed, or it would set defaultly as null if that parameter is not given, means do not do change this kind of information. This method can change part of data, vitalSign, symptoms and arrivalTime. Method Patient is used for nurse to regist a new patient with name and date of birth. Next method setSeen can change boolean seenByDoctor. Method getUrgency would analyse the date of birth and nearest vital signs and return the urgerncy level of this patient.

The Nurse class will have a Login method to let nurse load Map patients from Database and create a local copy on nurse's divice. Nurse can Operate this localPatients. As nurse finish the record, he or she need to use method saveAll to commit the localPatients to Database. When a patient come , nurse need to use method RecordData to record or create this patient's data, refresh the arrivalTime and change his or her seenByDoctor to False. This method can check whether the patient is new or existing in localPatients. Method SetVitalSign and SetSymptoms allows nurse to add a new pair of (record time:vital sign/symptoms)to the end of vitalSign/symptom of a patient. Method SetChecked calls setSeen in class Patient and mark the patient as seend by doctor. The nurse can also use the method GetPatient using health card number as the parameter to get all information of patient with this health card number.Method GetUrgencyList and GetArrivedTimeList will comparet the urgency or arrivalTime of all patients not seen by doctor and return a list of patients arranged by urgency or arrivalTime.
